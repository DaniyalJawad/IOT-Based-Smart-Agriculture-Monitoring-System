# IOT-Based-Smart-Agriculture-Monitoring-System
This Repository contain the code of the project 
I use Esp8266 by which i can measure reading of soil moisture sensor, temperture sensor
This file contain the code for smart agriculture monitoring system 
What's the main feature of this project is when soil moister level decreases from 35 the motor will spray water to plants and crops automatically and when soil moisture reaches to 38 it will stop spraying water 
If the light intensity is below 200 then artifical sunlight will ON 
else if the light intensity is above 200 the it will automatically turn OFF the light 
and I also get all the sensors reading wirelessly on my laptop and I can also control the LED and motor from my laptop
